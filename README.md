# Random Restaurant Generator

This Random Restaurant Generator was built to help my spouse and I choose a restaurant when we are being indecisive.

## Specs

- Written in vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
- Pulls data from Google Spreadsheet API containing vegan-friendly restaurants in the Seattle Region.

### Current Version 1

V1 generates a random restaurant and link on button click.

### Future Version 2

The goal for V2 is to add filter options to help narrow down by location and cuisine keywords.
