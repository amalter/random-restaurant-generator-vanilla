# Random Restaurant Generator

This [Random Restaurant Generator](https://www.amberalter.com/fun/random-restaurant-generator/) was built to help my spouse and I choose a restaurant when we are being indecisive.

## Specs

- Written in vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
- Pulls data from [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXVoKMWnMvdVq2fhikqdwgSbVo86VVfFoOfDuwg5bPs/edit?usp=sharing) containing vegan-friendly restaurants in the Seattle Region.

### Version 1

V1 generated a random restaurant and link on button click.

### (Current) Version 2

V2 allows user to select filters for neighborhood and cuisine.

### (Future) Version 3

Foals for version three:

- Convert to dropdown menu for checkboxes to reduce clutter
- Build checkbox options dynamically from spreadsheet
